# embedded_systems_course
Hi! This repository contains a few labs from my embedded systems course. The purpose of these labs was to familiarize ourselves with the [Texas Instruments MSP432 microcontroller](https://www.ti.com/tool/MSP-EXP432E401Y) with the help of the [Code Composer IDE](https://www.ti.com/tool/CCSTUDIO). Most of the underlying code and libraries were provided to us and our task was to read and understand the code and then make small logic tweeks to have the MSP432 perform desired functions. So with this in mind I will add a disclaimer that a lot of this code is not mine. ðŸ“‘
