The purpose of lab 3 was for us to get familiar with different aspects of the MSP432 including the registers for configuration, the use of library functions, polling, peripherals, and establishing a UART communication.  This lab is broken off into several parts beginning with a header file and a main file which were provided for us. We were also provided with several task files in which we were to write code to perform different expected outcomes. 

- [lab3.h](https://github.com/espdieg/embedded_systems_course/blob/main/lab3/lab3.h) - here in this header file that was given to us it sets up the UART configuration and sets function prototypes for our tasks to complete
- [main.c](https://github.com/espdieg/embedded_systems_course/blob/main/lab3/main.c) - in our main file it is a rather simple file where we only need to modify the current task number we are running.
- [task_1_1.c](https://github.com/espdieg/embedded_systems_course/blob/main/lab3/task_1_1.c) - this file we did not make any code changes and were simply asked to ensure it compiled and ran successfully. As evidence of this we saw the LED1 blind red on the MSP432 board.
- [task_1_2.c](https://github.com/espdieg/embedded_systems_course/blob/main/lab3/task_1_2.c) - in this file we perform the exact same thing as in task_1_1 except that this time we make use of the [driver library](https://github.com/espdieg/embedded_systems_course/tree/main/lab3/ESLab3driverLib) which has been provided for us. This cleans our code slightly by allowing us to remove all the define statements we were given before.
- [task_1_3.c](https://github.com/espdieg/embedded_systems_course/blob/main/lab3/task_1_3.c) - for this task we are asked to have LED1 flash as well as LED2. Itâ€™s noted that LED2 is an RGB light and can have either red, blue, green, or any mixture of these colors. For our case we want it to blink red so we use port 2 pin 0. If we want it to be green we use pin 1, and for blue we use pin 2. It is also noted that we need to have LED1 blink and then LED2 blink after so we need to start one off as HIGH and the other as LOW so they do not blink at the same time.
